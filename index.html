            <h2>What is Technology Era ?</h2>
            
            <p>The technology era, often referred to as the Digital Age or Information Age, 
                has fundamentally transformed society, economy, and everyday life. One of its 
                key features is the widespread availability of the internet, enabling global 
                connectivity and instant communication.Another significant aspect of the technology 
                era is the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). 
                These technologies automate tasks, improving efficiency and accuracy across industries 
                such as manufacturing and customer service.The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) has
                seen everyday objects embedded with sensors and connected to the internet. This connectivity 
                allows data collection and remote control, creating smart environments in homes, cities, and 
                industries.
